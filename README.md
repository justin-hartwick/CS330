How do I approach designing software?

When I approach software design, I focus first on understanding what the project needs to accomplish and what is realistically possible with the tools available. For this project, that meant studying the reference image and breaking it down into simple, repeatable shapes rather than trying to overcomplicate the scene. I tend to design with structure in mind first and then layer in detail once the foundation is solid.

What new design skills has this project helped me develop?

This project helped me become more comfortable thinking in three dimensions and planning scenes using transformations. I improved my ability to judge scale, spacing, and balance within a 3D environment. I also learned how to simplify visual elements while still keeping the scene recognizable and intentional, which is something I struggled with early on.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed a gradual, milestone-based design process. I started with basic shapes and rough placement to confirm proportions and layout. Once that was working, I refined positioning, colors, and lighting. Each milestone built on the last, which made the project feel manageable and gave me time to adjust decisions as I saw the scene rendered on screen.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Breaking a project into visual and functional components can be applied to many areas of software development. This approach helps reduce errors, improves organization, and makes large projects easier to troubleshoot and improve over time.

How do I approach developing programs?

I focus on getting functionality working before worrying about polish. In this project, I made sure objects rendered correctly, transformations behaved as expected, and controls worked before refining appearance or layout.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I relied heavily on incremental testing. Making small changes and running the program often helped me quickly identify issues with positioning, lighting, or camera movement. I also became more comfortable modifying existing OpenGL code instead of treating it as untouchable.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a major role. Many elements needed adjustment after seeing how they behaved in the rendered scene. Camera placement, lighting intensity, and object spacing all improved through repeated testing and revision.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?

As the project progressed, my development process became more organized. I spent more time planning changes before coding and documenting decisions so they were easier to revisit later. This helped reduce rework and made debugging less frustrating.

How can computer science help me reach my goals?

Computer science gives me problem-solving skills that apply beyond just writing code. This course showed how software can be used to model real environments and systems, which connects to my broader interest in practical and applied computing.

How do computational graphics and visualizations apply to my future educational pathway?

Learning computational graphics strengthened my understanding of how low-level systems work together to produce visual results. This knowledge supports future coursework that involves simulations, visualization, or user-facing software.

How do computational graphics and visualizations apply to my future professional pathway?

These skills can be applied to training tools, simulations, data visualization, and interactive applications. Being able to design and build a functional 3D scene shows both technical understanding and the ability to work through complex problems step by step.
